## Fix

- pompt edit name doesnt work properly on mobile
    - maybe all setting should be in a separate window

## Todo

- save sequence in cookie and git

- home page with active sequences
    - being able to do track (sequence chaining)

- ion-fab play button

- edit instrument page beside midi sound:
    - we need samples
    - we need kind of "analog" sound using tonejs with sin/triangle/square sound and filters

- clicking add note should open a modal to select note

- randomize
    - group of sequence played
    - range of note played?
    - change picth every time sequence end
